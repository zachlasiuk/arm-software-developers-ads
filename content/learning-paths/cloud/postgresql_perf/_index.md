title: "Learn how to Tune PostgreSQL"
# Should start with a verb (learn, build, etc.), have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    This learning path presents some ideas on how to tune PostgreSQL.
# One sentence, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 60
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    DevOps professionals and anyone else interested in optimizing their PostgreSQL deployment.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives:
    - Learn to tune PostgreSQL
    - Learn to explore performance metrics

# 2-5 bullet points, one sentence each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Bare-metal host(s) or cloud node(s) with PostgreSQL installed
# List any prereqs needed before this learning path can be completed. Can include:
    # Online service accounts                                   (An Amazon Web Services account)
    # Prior knowledge                                           (Some familiarity with embedded programing)
    # Previous learning paths                                   (The Learning Path: Getting Started with Arm Virtual Hardware)
    # Particular tools/environments already being initialized   (An EC2 instance with AVH installed)
