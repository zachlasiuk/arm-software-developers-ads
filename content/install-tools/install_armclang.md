Arm Compiler for Embedded is a ***commercial, bare metal, cross-compiler*** for all Arm processors.

Host machine support includes:
- Windows (x86)
- Linux (x86 and Arch64) 


## Introduction

There are many versions of [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) available. In general, the latest version is recommended, as this will contain the latest optimization improvements, as well as support for the latest Arm IP. However, there are reasons you may wish to use earlier compiler versions, especially where Functional Safety is concerned, where a specific compiler version is often mandated. A special branch of Arm Compiler for Embedded, known as [Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded%20FuSa), is available for this use case.

Arm Compiler for Embedded and Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa are license managed.

## Using the compiler supplied with Arm Development Studio {#armds}

The easiest way to access and setup the compiler is to use the version provided with [Arm Development Studio](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Development%20Studio). A given Development Studio version will contain the latest compiler version available at the time of release, and is generally up to date.

Notes
- Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa is not _installed_ as part of Arm Development Studio, and must be downloaded seperately (see next section).
- Cortex-M users can also use the compiler as provided with [Keil MDK](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5).

## Download standalone compiler packages {#download}

Individual compiler packages for all supported host platforms can be downloaded from the Product Downloads section of the Arm website.

[Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-compiler-for-embedded)\
[Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-compiler-for-functional-safety)

These can either be used standalone or with your Arm Development Studio installation. For the latter, you must first [register](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain) your new compiler installation with Development Studio, before then [configuring](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101469/latest/Installing-and-configuring-Arm-Development-Studio/Register-a-compiler-toolchain/Configure-a-compiler-toolchain-for-the-Arm-DS-command-prompt) the environment to use that version.

To install on Windows, unzip the downloaded package, launch the installer, and follow on-screen prompts.
```console
win-x86_64\setup.exe
```

For Linux, extra the downloaded file and run the install_$platform.sh

To automate installation of a standalone compiler package on Linux which has been downloaded in the current directory:

For Linux x86_64 machines:

```console
mkdir tmp
mv ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-x86_64.tar.gz tmp
cd tmp
tar xvfz ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./install_x86_64.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive -d /home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18
```

For Linux aarch64 or arm64 machines:

```console
mkdir tmp
mv ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-aarch64.tar.gz tmp
cd tmp
tar xvfz ARMCompiler6.18_standalone_linux-aarch64.tar.gz
./install_aarch64.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --no-interactive -d /home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18
```

Remove the install data when complete.

```console
cd ..
rm -r tmp
```

Add the `bin` directory of the installation to the `PATH` and confirm `armclang` can be invoked.

For bash on Linux:

```console
export PATH=/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18/bin:$PATH
```

For csh or tcsh on Linux: 

```console
set path=(/home/$USER/ArmCompilerforEmbedded6.18/bin $path)
```

Further installation instructions are given in the [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100748/latest/Getting-Started/Installing-Arm-Compiler-for-Embedded).

## Setting up product license {#license}

Arm Compiler for Embedded and Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa are license managed. They can be enabled by a [Success Kit](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/success-kits), Arm Development Studio (Gold Edition for FuSa), or a standalone license. If you are unsure what you have access to, please contact your Arm representative. Subscribers to programs such as [Arm Flexible Access](https://www.arm.com/products/flexible-access) have success kit licenses available.

Since Arm Compiler for Embedded 6.18, and Arm Compiler for Embedded FuSa 6.16.2, Arm User-based licensing (UBL) is supported. To check if you have such a license enabled, use the command:

```console
armlm inspect
```

If a license is reported, then you are ready to use the compiler (and other Arm tools).

If no license is reported, you must [activate](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102516/latest/Using-user-based-licensing) your license appropriately.

If using earlier compiler versions standalone or if no UBL license is available, you will need to set the environment variable `ARM_PRODUCT_DEF` to the `\\sw\mappings\product.elmap` file of your compiler installation, and ensure the environment variable `ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE` is set to an appropriate license file or server.

For Windows:

```console
set ARM_PRODUCT_DEF=<Compiler_Install_Dir>\sw\mappings\product.elmap
set ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=port@server
```

For Linux:

```console
export ARM_PRODUCT_DEF=<Compiler_Install_Dir>/sw/mappings/product.elmap
export ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=port@server
```

See [this article](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka004977/latest) for more details.

## Get started {#start}

To check that the correct compiler version is being used:

```console
armclang --version
```

To verify everything is working, build a simple `Hello World` example as described [here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100748/latest/Getting-Started/Compiling-a-Hello-World-example).

```C
// Hello.c

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
```

```console
armclang --target=aarch64-arm-none-eabi hello.c
```
